# Yireo\_SeoTools
This project includes files of the Yireo\_SeoTools extension-suite for Magento. The goal of
this project is to create numerous modules - part of the same suite - that allow developers
to optimize SEO using various techniques.

This project is currently still in heavy development.

## Goals
Various SEO-solutions already exist out there for Magento, but most of them claim to
guarantee better SEO-ratings by applying generic tricks. However, generic tricks do not make
your site stand-out: You need to tune SEO for every site specifically, to get the best
results. No technical solution will ever change that.

Unfortunately, many of the current solutions allow for dirty tricks to be applied by Magento
shop-owners, while developers write the same code-solutions over-and-over again. Yireo wants
to change this: By creating an all-in-one solution that does NOT enforce SEO-rules, but
simply offers a "framework" (what's in a word) that makes it easier for SEO-experts to do
their work. 

## Technical parts
This extension actually serves as an extension-suite of various Magento modules, combined
into one single suite.
